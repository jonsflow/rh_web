## Architecture

### Components

1. **`risk_manager_web.py`** - Main Flask application
   - Web server and API endpoints

   - Account-specific routing and isolation

2. **`multi_account_manager.py`** - Multi-account orchestration
   - Account detection and management
   - Independent monitoring threads per account
   - Thread lifecycle management

3. **`account_detector.py`** - Account discovery
   - Robinhood account detection (Standard, Roth IRA, Traditional IRA)
   - Activity checking (positions/orders)
   - Account information caching

4. **`base_risk_manager.py`** - Core risk management functionality
   - Position loading from Robinhood API per account
   - Market data fetching and P&L calculations
   - Order parameter generation

5. **`templates/`** - Web interface templates
   - `account_selector.html` - Multi-account selection interface
   - `risk_manager.html` - Account-specific risk management dashboard

### API Endpoints

#### Multi-Account Endpoints
- **`GET /`** - Account selector interface
- **`GET /account/<account_prefix>`** - Account-specific dashboard
- **`GET /api/account/<account_prefix>/positions`** - Get positions for specific account
- **`POST /api/account/<account_prefix>/close-simulation`** - Execute orders for specific account (live-only)
- **`POST /api/account/<account_prefix>/trailing-stop`** - Configure trailing stops for specific account

#### Legacy Single-Account Endpoints (redirected)
- **`GET /api/positions`** - Redirects to account selector
- **`POST /api/close-simulation`** - Returns error directing to account-specific endpoint

### Data Flow

1. **Account Detection**: Automatic discovery of all Robinhood accounts on startup
2. **Authentication**: Automatic Robinhood login using cached credentials
3. **Account Selection**: User selects account from web interface
4. **Position Loading**: Fetch open long positions via `r.get_open_option_positions(account_number=...)`
5. **Market Data**: Real-time pricing via `r.get_option_market_data_by_id()`
6. **Risk Monitoring**: 1-second updates during market hours, 60-second intervals after hours
7. **Order Customization**: Interactive sliders and manual input for custom pricing
8. **Order Execution**: Account-specific `r.order_sell_option_limit()` calls
9. **Order Tracking**: `r.get_option_order_info(order_id)` for status monitoring

## Price Customization

### Interactive Sliders
- **Stop Loss**: 5% - 50% range with 1% increments
- **Take Profit**: 10% - 200% range with 5% increments
- Real-time price calculation as you move sliders
- Automatic limit price updates in order preview

### Manual Price Editing
- Click on any price field to edit manually
- Instant calculation of estimated proceeds
- Visual feedback for price changes
- Reset to default calculations available

### Order Preview
- Shows exact `robin_stocks.order_sell_option_limit()` call
- Updates dynamically with slider/manual changes
- Different preview for trailing stop orders (stop-limit type)
- Displays custom prices instead of default calculations

## Trailing Stop Logic

### How It Works
1. **Enable**: Set trailing stop percentage (5% - 50%)
2. **Track High**: System tracks highest price seen since activation
3. **Calculate Trigger**: `trigger_price = highest_price × (1 - percent/100)`
4. **Monitor**: Check every second during market hours per account
5. **Execute**: When `current_price ≤ trigger_price`, stop-limit order is triggered

### Example
- **Setup**: 20% trailing stop on option at $1.00
- **Price rises to $1.50**: `trigger_price = $1.20`
- **Price drops to $1.19**: 🔥 **TRIGGERED!** (stop-limit order submitted)

## Market Hours

- **Active Monitoring**: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET (1-second updates)
- **After Hours**: 60-second monitoring intervals (options don't trade after hours)
- **Weekends**: Minimal monitoring
- **Independent per Account**: Each account monitored separately

## Multi-Account Safety

### Account Isolation
- **Separate Risk Managers**: Each account gets its own `BaseRiskManager` instance
- **Independent Monitoring**: Separate threads prevent cross-contamination
- **Account-Specific Orders**: All orders tagged with specific account numbers
- **Isolated Position Tracking**: Positions never mixed between accounts

### Account Types Supported
- **Standard Brokerage**: Regular trading account
- **Roth IRA**: Tax-advantaged retirement account  
- **Traditional IRA**: Traditional retirement account
- **Automatic Detection**: System discovers all available account types

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This system can place real orders with real money when run in live mode.

### Before Using Live Trading:
1. **Understand** trailing stop and price customization behavior
2. **Verify** all position details and custom limit prices
3. **Start small** with non-critical positions
4. **Monitor actively** during first live sessions
5. **Confirm account selection** before executing orders

### Risk Management:
- Only handles long option positions (buy-to-close orders)
- Uses limit orders only (no market orders)
- Account isolation prevents accidental cross-account operations
- Requires explicit confirmation for live trading
- Provides detailed logging of all activities per account
- Custom pricing allows for better risk control

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors:**
- Ensure Robinhood credentials are valid
- Check 2FA settings if applicable

**No Accounts Found:**
- Verify Robinhood login is successful
- Check account permissions for API access

**No Positions Found:**
- Verify you have open long option positions in selected account
- Check position types (only long positions supported)

**Price Customization Issues:**
- Ensure custom prices are reasonable (> $0.01)
- Check that sliders are working in close position modal
- Verify calculated prices match expected values

**Order Submission Failures:**
- Verify account has sufficient permissions
- Check position quantities and custom limit prices
- Ensure options are still valid (not expired)
- Confirm account selection is correct

### Debug Mode
All operations include detailed console logging for debugging and verification, including account-specific identifiers.
